### Data Processing Pipeline on Azure

I'm proposing to setup a dataset processing, which consist of ingestion, processing and storing
or different version of dataset using data version control on azure. the resulting dataset, in different versions
will be stored on an object storage connected to a data-lake. 

### Goal

Data preparation for ML/AI using data-lake on a cloud environment

### Scenarios

1. MLE as a solution developer, defines pipeline to have data preparation in
isolation for consumers, Data Scientists or Data Analysts, which eventually they
can have an environment that they define they pipelines (dataset processing). 
2. Data Scientists / Data Analysts use the provided automated pipeline, create a script, 
implement the processing methods and register/store the tagged varied dataset in the data lake.

### Technology / Implementation

TODO
